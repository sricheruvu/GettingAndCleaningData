### Description
Additional information about the variables, data and transformations used in the course project for the Johns Hopkins University (JHU) Getting and Cleaning Data course.

### Source Data
A full description of the data used in this project can be found at [The UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

### Data Set Information
The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.

Variable list and descriptions
------------------------------

Variable name    | Description
-----------------|------------
subjectID        | ID the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30.
activityID       | Activity ID
dt_features      | Contains all the features from the features.txt file
dt_activityType  | Contains all the activities from the activity_labels.txt file. The activities are: walking, walkingupstairs, walkingdownstairs, sitting, standing, laying
dt_subjectTrain  | Contains all the training data done by each subject from the file subject_train.txt
dt_xTrain        | Contains the training data from the x_train.txt file
dt_yTrain        | Contains the training data from the y_train.txt file
subjectTest      | Contains the testing data from subject_test.txt file
xTest            | Contains the testing data from x_test.txt file
yTest            | Contains the testing data from y_test.txt file

### Attribute Information
For each record in the dataset it is provided: 
- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration. 
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

### Section 1. Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.
After setting the source directory for the files, read into tables the data located in
- features.txt
- activity_labels.txt
- subject_train.txt
- x_train.txt
- y_train.txt
- subject_test.txt
- x_test.txt
- y_test.txt

Assign column names and merge to create one data set.

## Section 2. Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
Create a logcal vector that contains TRUE values for the ID, mean and stdev columns and FALSE values for the others.
Subset this data to keep only the necessary columns.

## Section 3. Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Merge data subset with the activityType table to cinlude the descriptive activity names

## Section 4. Appropriately label the data set with descriptive activity names.
Use gsub function for pattern replacement to clean up the data labels.

## Section 5. Create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 
Per the project instructions, we need to produce only a data set with the average of each veriable for each activity and subject
